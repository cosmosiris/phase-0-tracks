  <h1>Dealing With My Critical Inner Voice</h1>
  <p>Throughout my DBC program it will be very important for me to think positively and practice positive self-talk. Below are some tips to help me succeed</p>
  <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Create a schedule of days & times to complete assignments and stick to it</li>
      <li>Exercise 4-5 days a week</li>
      <li>Schedule time to practice typing and memory skills</li>
      <li>Schedule time to learn extra skills not covered in the week's materials</li>
      <li>Give myself at least 2 hours a day of leisure, preferrably in the evenings before I go to sleep</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps for Dealing with a Negative Thought that is impairing my ability to focus</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Identify the negative thought</li>
      <li>Identify the trigger for this negative thought</li>
      <li>Determine my options. For example, if my negative thought is telling me to give up and try again tomorrow then I have at least 3 options:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Give up and try again tomorrow</li>
          <li>Take a short 5-10 minute break and then continue working</li>
          <li>Ignore the negative thought and continue working till my scheduled end time</li>
        </ol>
      <li> The determine the potential outcomes of each option. List the pros and cons of each outcome</li>
      <li> Then make a decision that is intelligent and well thought out. In the example above I would most likely realize that procrastinating will set me behind schedule which could result in a lot of other poor outcomes like having to cancel plans that I've made, or not being prepared for a mandatory peer to peer work session. </li>
  </ol>
