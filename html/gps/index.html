1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  Semantic tags are meant to guide anyone who is reading the source code. It really just helps to organize the code into meaningful sections

2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  The browser displays elements based on the order in which they are placed in the html file, UNLESS, the CSS style sheet changes the order.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  I learned that you can create your own code snippets in Sublime and I will definitely be creating my own snippets!

4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  I didn't find anything challenging. I just need to practice making my own snippets and I also look forward to learning how to create a beautiful nav bar!
