# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. Version control is useful for two powerful reasons. First, it allows developers to see their previous code and revert to a previous version of their code if neccessary. Second, it allows multiple developers to work on one project at the same time while seeing each developer's code progression. In addition to these two main uses, version control allows you to compare files and it allows you manage mistakes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a project or file. Branches allow you to make changes to code without changing the original file. This allows you to add and test features while also getting feedback on your changes before merging your changes with the original file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is basically a record of a change that has been made to a file. A commit is also called a "save point". Developers must refer to save points when they want to review previous code. A good commit message is one that is simple yet clearly describes the change that was made.

* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when competing changes have been made to the same line of code in a file OR when one person is attempting to edit a file that was deleted by another person.
