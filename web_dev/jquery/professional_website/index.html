    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a former teacher and community organizer who recently moved to the Bay to pursue a career in software engineering. My work as a community organizer revealed to me that 1)many local non-profit organizations struggle to be efficient because they lack the technical resources to maximize the investments of their employees and volunteers 2)most of the popular project management and communication tools are designed for corporations and do not meet the unique needs of social justice organizations that rely heavily on volunteers. In October of 2016 I began working on an app idea that could revolutionize how grasroots social justice organizations function. I then began to teach myself programming through online tutorials. In June of 2017 I left my job as a teacher and I have been learning software development full-time ever since. I am looking to expand my skills at a company that will both nourish my thirst for learning and be open to my creativity which is a product of my wide ranging and unique experiences dating back to childhood</p>

    <h3>2.5 Solo challenge</h3>
    <p>Checkout my <a href="https://cosmosiris.wordpress.com/">personal website</a> which is created through wordpress. The site is great because everything is centered and spaced in a way that is appealing to the eye. The nav bar at the top is also nice and much better than the one I have on this page. When looking at the source code, I recognize a lot of the elements but there are a few I don't recognize. For example: script tag, meta element, and the style tag. It seems that the script tag indicates the use of a different language, in this case it is javascript. The meta element looks like it scales the website to according the size of the browser, and the style tag looks like it's used to insert stylistic features to the page. <em>Please note that I changed the name of the folder from "website" to "professional_website"</em></p>
