      <p>While volunteering as a community organizer I noticed that many of the social justice organizations I worked with were struggling to balance responsibilities, grow membership, strenghten relationships, and hold members accountable--all of which are necessary to building a sustainable and efficient organization. Little accountability, lack of transparency, and slow decision-making also kept really important projects from getting off the ground. I built Organ Eyez to deal with these internal problems that many social justice organizations face. Technology has helped thousands of corporations scale upwards into powerful forces whilst non-corporate entities are left struggling to keep up. Organ Eyez uses computer software to give organizers a better shot at changing their communities and ultimately, changing the world.</p>
